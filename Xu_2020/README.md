# UMAP analysis of bacterial and fungal communities on building materials

Analysis code in this repository refers to a paper published in 2020 that was a comprehensive study on the bacterial and fungal communities on 
building materials. The original analyses can be viewed at the following link: https://github.com/vera-yxu/Thesis-QuantitativeAnalysis.git

I have included images of the best UMAP visualizations that I could derive. The visualizations were then labeled by material.
